# fMRIproc_MSc_Thesis
Codes used in my MSc for preprocessing and seed based fMRI analysis

This repository contains the source code and scripts used in my master's thesis for preprocessing and analyzing medical images. The project involves converting DICOM images to NifTI format, organizing images in BIDS format, quality evaluation, intensity uniformity corrections, skull stripping, tissue segmentation, and more, using RStudio, FSL, and Python 3.
